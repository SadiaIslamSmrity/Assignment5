Ans (1):
getElementById is used when I want to call a single element by its id which is unique and a single element will be called.
getElementByClassName works for every element named with that same class.

querySelector finds the element that matches with the query but
querySelectorAll returns all the matching element as a NodeList.

I create new element by using document.createElement()
